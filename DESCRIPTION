Description: 
    cloneman implements functions to parse and handle CNV segments and clonal information from various
    common packages
    At this point for CNV (and clonal information if available) we can use
    ASCAT, CloneCNA, ControlFreec, FACETS, SuperFreq.
    For clonal information (which includes both CNV and SNV events) we can use
    SuperFreq, PhyloWGS (not implemented yet)
    For clonal information based only on SNV events we can use
    PyClone-VI, Sciclone, FastClone (neither is implemented yet).
    The structure of the object contains
    * GRanges with CNV segments, this is coming from any supported tool with additional information added to
    ensure consistency for all tools
    * GRanges list with SNV events.
    The parse* functions return typically GRanges objects with segments and/or SNVs
    the load* functions create cloneobj with more rich information (including purity, ploidy if supported by the tool)
    For more information check the help of the cloneman package.

Description: 
    cloneman implements functions to parse and handle CNV segments and clonal information from various
    common packages
    At this point for CNV (and clonal information if available) we can use
    ASCAT, CloneCNA, ControlFreec, FACETS, SuperFreq.
    For clonal information (which includes both CNV and SNV events) we can use
    SuperFreq, PhyloWGS (not implemented yet)
    For clonal information based only on SNV events we can use
    PyClone-VI, Sciclone, FastClone (neither is implemented yet).
    The structure of the object contains
    * dataframe with clone information, i.e. name, CCF, number of SNV events and number of CNV segments
    * GRangesList with CNV segments, each member of the list containst the segments assigned to a clone
      if the events of multiple clones are overlapping, e.g. if a maternal clone is present with all the events
      and a daughter clone is also having some of the maternal events
      the GRangesList elements must be preprocessed 
    * GRanges list with SNV events.
    The parse* functions return typically GRanges objects with segments and/or SNVs
    the load* functions create cloneobj with more rich information
    For more information check the help of the cloneman package.

\title{Generate a cnv Granges from a dataframe created by CloneCNA}
\usage{
parseCloneCNA(clonecna)
}
\arguments{
\item{clonecna}{input filename with CNV segments or an already parsed dataframe,}
}
\value{
A GRanges object with the segments predicted by CloneCNA
}
\description{
CloneCNA claims that can efficiently and accurately identify somatic copy number alterations from
heterogeneous tumor samples. (https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-016-1174-7)
CloneCNA can detect teh cellularity of each abberation, and from that extract the subclonal abundance. T
his comes in the column Cellularity.
When Cellularity is 0 it indicates normal
Presumably, segments with different values in that column correspond to different clones. As a result we can tag different clones based on these frequencies.
